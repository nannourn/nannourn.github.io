Hi, I'm Nan! I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Fisheries & Wildlife and Ecology, Evolution & Behavior program at Michigan State University.

My research interests include interdisciplinary research, wildlife ecology, conservation biology, socio-ecological systems, and Bayesian and spatial statistics. I apply research tools from these relevant disciplines in order to examine pressing issues in conservation and sustainability in Southeast Asia.
