Hi, I'm Nan! I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of [Fisheries & Wildlife](https://fw.msu.edu) and [Ecology, Evolution & Behavior](https://eeb.msu.edu) program at Michigan State University.

My scholarly interests include interdisciplinary research, wildlife ecology, conservation biology, socio-ecological systems, remote sensing and Bayesian and spatial statistics. I apply research tools from these relevant disciplines in order to examine pressing issues in conservation and sustainability in Southeast Asia.
