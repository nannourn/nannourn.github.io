# Intro 

A lot goes into prepping for hunts on public land out west, and a key tenent in being successful relates directly to ecology--you must know what habitat your game animal of choice is residing. thus, a map detailing types of landcover and elevation might prepare us better for knowing which areas to invest our hiking and spotting in. Our end goal is a raster-type map showing us where to go!

## Packages
```{r library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(FedData)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(stars)
library(tmap)
library(here)
data_dir <- here("data")
```

## Downloading and Organizing the Data

I have a shapefile of the boundary units that I am interested in, which is elk hunt units designated by FWP in Montana. I am interested in landcover across these hunt units. Extract data from NLCD using `getData` function. We'll also use the handy color palette function to map the corresponding land cover classes.
